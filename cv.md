#### About me:
I am a second-year student at the Belarusian State University. Half a year ago I became intrested in Frontend Development and have been pursuing it for three months now, mostly using self-education platforms and courses. It looks like education at RSSchool is proper next step on my way to professional developent.

Hopefully, my persistence, attentiveness and knowledge, accumulated during this time, will help me succeed in the course and obtain enough skills to land a job in IT sphere.
